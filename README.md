# Weather App — Frontend + C++ OOP example

## Overview
- The frontend is a small OOP-style JavaScript web app that fetches current weather from OpenWeatherMap and displays it.
- The `cpp/` folder contains a C++ object-oriented sample that models `Weather` and shows how to fetch and parse JSON from the same API using `libcurl` and `nlohmann/json`.

## Frontend (run locally)
1. Put your OpenWeatherMap API key in `app.js`:
   ```js
   config.apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
